#ISS Map Viewer Tracker
This project is a web-based viewer that tracks the position of the International Space Station (ISS) on a map in real-time. The application refreshes ISS's position every 5 seconds, creating an interactive and visually engaging experience for the users. The user interface also includes a brief description of the ISS, it's history, and contributions from different countries.

The project was completed in approximately 45 minutes with the assistance of ChatGPT, OpenAI's powerful language model.
